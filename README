A small, dynamically-typed, garbage-collected scripting language. Basic
control flow, integers, functions, strings, vectors and simple I/O is about
all you get. Passing arguments to functions as well as assignment are by
value, but string and vector values are just fat pointers to heap data, so
passing and copying them is cheap. Mark-and-sweep is used for garbage
collection and is triggered when there's not enough heap space to allocate new
memory.

To compile and execute a script stored in `filename.crb`:

    cargo run filename.crb
